    description: "The Audi Q8 e-tron is the renamed and significantly updated continuation of the original Audi e-tron. This mid-size luxury electric SUV features revised styling with a new enclosed Singleframe grille design and updated lighting signatures. The most significant improvements are technical: battery capacity increased to 106 kWh (from 95 kWh), providing an extended range of up to 360-380 miles (WLTP) depending on the variant. Motor efficiency and thermal management were also improved. Like its predecessor, the Q8 e-tron is available in both standard SUV and Sportback body styles with a choice of dual-motor powertrains. The Q8 e-tron 55 produces up to 402 HP in boost mode, while the Q8 e-tron S features a three-motor setup (one front, two rear) generating 496 HP. The interior maintains Audi's premium quality with updated technology and increased use of sustainable materials. The Q8 e-tron represents Audi's ongoing refinement of its electric vehicle technology and positions the vehicle more clearly within the brand's naming hierarchy."
